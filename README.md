# GrETEL 4

This is currently under active development. The stable predecessor can be found at http://gretel.ccl.kuleuven.be/gretel3 (and the source at https://github.com/CCL-KULeuven/gretel/).

## Info
* v3.9.99 November 2017: GrETEL 4 currently under development!
* v3.0.2 July 2017: Show error message if the BaseX server is down  
* v3.0. November 2016: GrETEL 3 initial release. Available at http://gretel.ccl.kuleuven.be/gretel3

### Branches

master: official version of GrETEL 4, available at http://gretel.hum.uu.nl/gretel3/
dev: development version  
gretel2.0: official version of GrETEL 2.0, available at http://gretel.ccl.kuleuven.be/gretel-2.0  

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Next to a standard LAMP server (with a PHP version > 5.4), GrETEL requires the following packages to be installed on your machine:

* [BaseX](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/database/basex)
* [SimpleXML](http://php.net/manual/en/book.simplexml.php)
* [Perl](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/perl/perl) with:
  * [XML::Twig](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libxml-twig-perl)
  * [XML::XPath](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libxml-xpath-perl)

### Next steps

1. Download (or clone) GrETEL from GitHub.
2. Download the Alpino dependency parser. Current binary used in the live version: `Alpino-x86_64-linux-glibc2.5-20548-sicstus` (available [here](http://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/alp/Alpino/versions/binary)). 

> It is recommended to use the same version used for creating the treebanks. This way an example based search will result in the same search structure as stored in the database.

3. Create BaseX databases containing the treebanks you want to make available.
4. Adapt `config.example.php` file and change name to `config.php`, and then:
  * Set the path to the Alpino dependency parser in the variable `$alpinoDirectory` (by default: directory `parsers`)
  * Set BaseX variables (machine names, port numbers, password and username)
5. Run `npm install` and `grunt` to compile all the JavaScript and stylesheet files.

## Notes for users

Only the properties of the first node matched by an XPATH variable is returned for analysis. For example:

A user searches for `//node[node]`. Two variables are found in this query: `$node1 = //node` and `$node2 = $node1[node]`.

The following sentence would match this query: 

`node[np] (node[det] node[noun])`

The node found for `$node1` will then be `node[np]`. 
The node found for `$node2` will then be `node[det]`. The properties of `node[noun]` will not be available for analysis using this query.

When searching for a more specific structure, this is unlikely to occur.

## Notes for developers


### Front-end
* We used [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html) as our stylesheet markdown of preference. All styles are available as `.scss` files (`styles/scss/`). For users who do not want to work with SCSS/SASS we also included the expanded CSS output of the SCSS files (`styles/css/`). In production, however, we use the minfied files (`styles/css/min/`) to decrease load times.
* We do not support Internet Explorer because we highly rely on the power of the flexbox specification. Internet Explorer does not provide (good) support for flex properties. Microsoft's newer, and better, browser Edge is supported.
* JavaScript files are also provided as expanded (`js/`) as well as minified files (`js/min/`). We use jQuery as the library of choice.
* Results are 'flushed' to the user by use of subsequent ajax requests. Therefore, JavaScript _has_ to be enabled by users.
* Newer functionality is built in TypeScript and can be found under `ts/`. This code is transpiled to JavaScript and placed under `js/ts`.


### Back-end
* The results that are flushed to the user at a time as well as the maximum results that will be fetched is stored in variables in `config.php`. Change `$flushLimit` and `$resultsLimit` to the values that you want.
* Scripts are organised according to their function:
  * `basex-search-scripts/`: scripts that are required to do the actual searching for results. However, the `basex-client.php` is sometimes needed in other cases as well to open up a BaseX session.
  * `front-end-includes/`: files that are included or required by other scripts and that present content rather than execute functions are stored here (e.g. `head.php`, `footer.php`). Content that is shared between the example-based search and the XPath search can be found here as well Â§e.g. `results-shared-content.php`).
  * `preparatory-scripts/`: scripts that run functions on the input leading up to but not including the actual fetching of results. These scripts manipulate do things such as creating XPath, generating breadth-first patterns, parsing the input, and modifying input examples.
  * `functions.php`: contains general functions that are often required but that are not specific to any part of the process
  * `helpers.php`: basic helper functions that return booleans.

### During development
* We use [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) to auto-compile SCSS (Ruby and Sass have to be installed in the PATH: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass) and auto-minify CSS and JavaScript.
* Note that some client-side code is in Typescript `ts/`, this code is automatically compiled using Grunt.
* Commands to install Grunt, local dependencies and then to watch for changes:


      sudo apt-get install npm
      sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
      sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

      npm install

      grunt watch
