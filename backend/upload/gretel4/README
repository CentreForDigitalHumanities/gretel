This directory contains the configuration file for the treebanks that were
preconfigured in previous versions of GrETEL (4 and before). Use them with
the import-existing management command to import treebanks that are already
present in BaseX:

% python manage.py import-existing TREEBANK.json

The configuration files may also be used as examples for your own imports.
